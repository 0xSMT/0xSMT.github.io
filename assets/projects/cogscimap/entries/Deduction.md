Deduction is a form of inference where the flow of logic is from provided statements (antecedents) to a certain and definite conclusion (consequent). Deductive inferences can be chained together, by using the consequent of a previous deductive rule as the antecedent of another deductive rule. 

In a more abstract sense, deduction is a deterministic, top-down process. More general antecedents eventually result in a more specific conclusion. Most of computation is generally considered a top-down, deductive process, where computable statements (and the program as a whole) is akin to a proof (see Curry-Howard isomorphism).
