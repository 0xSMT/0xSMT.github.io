Robotics is a field within computer science concerned with the interaction of computers with the real world. Source code provides instructions for how a robotic system actuates and moves in an environment, given sensory input. 

Robotics is a good example of a cognitive system. It has cognition (encoded in source code and programs), a body, and an environment. Rather than living purely in the abstract, robots exist in the real as well, occupying (roughly) the same environment as biological cognitive systems.
