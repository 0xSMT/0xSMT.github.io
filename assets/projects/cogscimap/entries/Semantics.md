Semantics is a branch of linguistics and language theory responsible for the meaning of a word.

Meaning itself is an abstract concept, but can be imagined as the literal 'idea' a word, sentence, or linguistics unit refers to.

The semantic meaning of `cat` is the idea of a cat, whereas the semantic meaning of `Checkers`, where Checkers is the name of a specific cat, would be that specific cat.

Of course, semantics itself is heavily reliant on context, which would be a topic of study of sentential semantics. Saying "I'm playing with Checkers" likely means the speaker is playing with the cat Checkers, bu if they instead said "I'm playing checkers", they likely instead mean they are playing the board game checkers. This illustrates the influence of syntax in proper semantic interpretation. 

In programming languages, semantics can mean several things, but typically refers to the meaning (read: execution) of the resulting program. The semantics of an `if` statement is a branching conditional. Denotational semantics is a common strategy in computer science for proving what a program means. 

Semantics is incredibly important in cognitive science, if not of foundational importance. Understanding the semantic meaning of a sentence strikes at the heart of cognition, where symbols in a sentence are transformed into mental objects, and operations on those mental objects occur within the mind according to instructions encoded in the sentence itself. In short, a sort-of Curry-Howard isomorphism happens, where there is a relation between parsing and comprehension of language to the operations occuring within the mind.

At a computational level, semantics of cognition refers to the meaning of a cognitive process. Just as an algorithm implemented in a programming language (a program in a source file) has a semantic interpretation (the algorithm itself), something similar applies in cognition. What's the semantics of a neural network?
