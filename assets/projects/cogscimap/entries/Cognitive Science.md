Cognitive science is the multidisciplinary study of the mind. The mind has been examined from the perspective of many fields, with each field representing the mind with different levels of abstraction, methods, and tools. The aim of cognitive science is to use these tools collectively to obtain an improved and more holistic understanding of the mind.

Cognitive science emerged from the cognitive revolution within psychology in the 1950s. The revolution was a byproduct of new advances in computing, specifically researchers modeling components of cognition (such as neurons and artificial intelligence). Consequently, psychologists themselves began using the computer as a model for the mind: the mind as an information-processing system. Thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, Arthur Samuel, Ulric Neisser, and Alan Turing were all present in the zeitgeist that contributed to the transition from the behaviorist school to cognitive perspectives.

Four major subdivisions of cognitive science are neuroscience, psychology, computer science, and linguistics. Each of these fields studies different parts of the mind and through different strategies. Neuroscience address the organic hardware from which the mind emerges. Psychology studies the emergent properties of the brain (the human mind itself). Computer science attempts to imitate and construct minds through the formal and mathematical properties. Linguistics deals with the properties of communicating minds and of language, a treasured characteristic of cognition. As a whole, each discipline looks at the mind at a different level of abstraction. 

Contributions in cognitive science can occur indirectly. Developments in psychology alone (without awareness of cognitive science broadly) still influences the field of cognitive sciences. The cognitive science program is more of a nebulous framework, rather than a strict school of thought. It is a cross-disciplinary effort, and achievements within the subfields are always influential. 

Thanks to their common subject, each field can have meaningful impacts on one another. The goal of cognitive science is to obtain a general, broad understanding of the mind, by taking insights from each field and melding them together, using concepts from one field in another, or simply using findings within the field to obtain a clearer picture of the mind in a holistic sense, whether that mind be in a human, animal, machine, or in the abstract sense.
