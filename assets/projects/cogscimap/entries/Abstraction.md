Abstraction is an important (yet, funnily abstract) concept throughout cognition. It means roughly different things in computer science and psychology -- and yet, the two meanings are very similar, if not identical. 

In computer science, abstraction is a design technique. It allows the programmer to encapsulate common details into a single unit. ... Rather than writing the same 12 lines of code several times, those lines can be collapsed into one function, with a name which describes this function's behavior. 

Grouping common behavior in this way forms a new layer of abstraction. Consider the operation of a computer -- binary, machine code, registers, and all the nastiness otherwise. Programming languages allow programmers to avoid this hairiness. A function or keyword in the programming language contains all the binary code that the programmer would otherwise need to write. User interfaces are abstractions over the actual program -- the user is launching and running functions by interacting with the interface (as you are on this cognitive map!), but need not know that they are. Abstraction levels exist throughout software, and allow programmers to reuse code and manage complexity. 

In psychology, abstraction is a process by which concepts are brought to a purer and simpler (read: more abstract) form. Abstracting a concept means to reduce the complexity of an idea to a simpler version, rather than the literal idea itself. Consider observing a bird. The bird can be many different species, can be old, can be dirty -- but for a lot of reasoning purposes, all that matter is it's a bird. Abstraction allows the world to be codified and simplified. Abstraction deals with the idea and concept of the bird, rather than the literal bird itself. 

Abstract thinking is considered of the final stages of psychological development, and reflects high-level mental processes. Rather than accepting and taking observed phenomena at face value and as sensory input, mental operations are performed on the category of the object. A focus on the metaphorical rather than the literal.

In some sense, the meaning of abstraction in psychology and computer science is very similar. It's about categorization and grouping of common details, and simplifying a complex concept. The simplification allows the idea to be reasoned with at a different level of complexity, where there are fewer variables to contend with.
