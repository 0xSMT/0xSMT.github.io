An action is a behavioral decision taken by a cognitive agent. While an agent has no direct control over their own state, they have some agency over what actions they take. 

This model of agent decision making is common in artificial intelligence, and seems over into other cognitive disciplines. Its generality makes it helpful, and is an intuitive model for agent (artificial or biological) decision making in environments. Rather than modeling state transitions directly, the agent instead has sway over what actions it takes, which then results in state changes. Many times, learning is frames as determined what actions to take in which states to obtain the states it wants.

Actions are a general set. Actions can be much of anything, from motion to more complex behaviors. The only guiding rule is selection of acitions is directly controllable, and have some impact on state.
