Source code is a computer file which contains a program, a file filled with lines of text, describing an algorithm (in a particular programming language) that the computer will run whe prompted. 

Rather than the pure, logical form of the algorithm, a source code file contains instructions for executing that algorithm *in a particular programming language*. Consider giving someone instructions. Consider giving someone else those same instructions, but in a different language. The idea is roughly the same (the algorithm, the semantics), but the literal information content (source code) is very different. 

Interestingly, programs can also take source code as input, produce source code, and modify their own source code, since source code is but another form of data. This allows for a novel form of recursion, one called automatic programming and program synthesis.
