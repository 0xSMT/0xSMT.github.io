Functions are a mathematical tool for mapping an input value to an output value.

An input value is always mapped to one output value. 

Functions are the bedrock of mathematics, and form the most general abstraction mechanism in all disciplines. 

In computer science, a function is a container for a program A function alone is representative of all computer science (via the lambda calculus). In software design, functions often contain code, and are given a name that describes their execution pattern. Functions then form a new layer of abstraction in software, where the function name encodes the responsibility of its contents, and rather than knowing how to use its inner code, one merely need to know how to use the function itself -- it encapsulates and hides details, so its role can be reasoned with at a higher level of logic.
