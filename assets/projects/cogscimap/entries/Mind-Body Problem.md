Mind-Body Problem is a problem in psychology about the relation between the idea of the mind and the physical manifestation of the mind, a philosophical problem tracing as far back as Descartes.

The cognitive sophistication of a system is very dependent on the sophistication of its body, and in fact, its physical shell dictates what is computable and what is not. 

Cognition is not an ephemeral concept. It is married to the context of the thinking itself, which takes the form of the environment and body of the thinking agent. Certainly, whatever cognition the agent is capable of doing, ca only be exhibited through the environment and its own actions and body -- the mind is black-boxed in this way. Inferences about the cognition of a system (beyond a designed cognitive system, and even some of those, such as those created with artificial neural networks) can only be made based on this exhibited evidence.
