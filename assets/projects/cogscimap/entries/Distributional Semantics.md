Distributional semantics is a hypothesis regarding the meaning of words. The theory is that rather than words having explicit meanings, their definition is instead derived from surrounding context. 

For example, in this model, `prince` is similar to `king` because they both could appear almost interchangeably. 

This theory has been used to great effect in natural language processing in computer science, as it makes quantifying semantic meaning very simple. Provided a massive set of data (coined a corpus in linguistics), the meaning of an individual word A can be compared to another word B by seeing how likely would it be for A to appear in B's context.
