Prime Numbers are natural numbers which are not evenly divisible other than by 1 and itself. So 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 31 are examples of prime numbers. 

Prime numbers are important throughout computer science (due to their unique traits), but also possess a striking similarity (other than in name) to semantic primes. Rather than being fundamental units of language, prime numbers form the fundamental units of numbers. In fact, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is as follows:

Every natural number (integer greater than 1) is either a prime number, or the finite product of prime numbers. In this sense, the set of prime numbers generates all numbers (greater than 1) via multiplication. No other set of numbers can accomplish this feat -- this is at minimum true because a prime number cannot be generated via nay other means other than through itself. What is extraordinary is every other number can be generated via the product of prime numbers.
