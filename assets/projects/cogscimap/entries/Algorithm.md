Algorithms form the bedrock of computer science, and it the primary topic of discussion within that field. Algorithms are designed to do a motley of tasks (such as sorting, navigation, classification, counting), can be compared in terms of performance, efficiency, scalability, and accuracy. Any set of rules for solving a problem is an algorithm. 

Strictly speaking, an algorithm is anything a Turing Machine can do. A program provided to a Turing Machine is an algorithm, should the program terminate. Not all algorithms terminate, which is to say, not all functions are computable. This is the subject of the infamous halting problem in computer science, which proves not all functions are computable by a Turing Machine (cannot be solved by an algorithm).

In relation to cognitive science, many cognitive processes can be reduced (or approximated) to algorithms. The question remains: can all cognitive processes be reduced to algorithms?
