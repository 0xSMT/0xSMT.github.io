Parsing is a method of interpreting a string of symbols strung together in a sequence. The symbols are grouped together (and form new symbols) via syntactic rules that describe the language the string of symbols is written in. The syntactic rules are married to the language of the sentence (where a sentence is a particular sequence of symbols). 

Parsing is how a cognitive (or computational) system makes sense of communicated content. Parsing gives structure to a sentence, and this structure gives information content, information that's not explicitly embedded in the sentence, but rather latent in characteristics of the sentence itself.
