An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model of the biological neural network. It attempts to model the function of a neural network to solve pattern recognition tasks.

ANNs take many forms. Convolutional ANNs are inspired by neural networks in the visual cortex, where visual and sensory information is funneled through several layers for feature detection, and area best applied to information where spatial awareness is key. Recurrent ANNs use recursion and memory, and are useful for sequential tasks, like language processing.

Their sudden popularity is a testament to large increases in computational power and parallelism. However, they are still distant from the power of biological nervous systems. 

The ANN paradigm is popular not only due to its power, but its generality. A wide variety of computational problems have been successfully tackled using neural networks, using roughly the same tools.
