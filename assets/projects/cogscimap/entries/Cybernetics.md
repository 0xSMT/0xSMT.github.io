Cybernetics is the historical precursor to artificial intelligence. It focused primarily on control theory and the regulation of systems towards desired behavior. In some respects, it acted as a precursor to cognitive science, as it hoped to study "control and communication in the animal and the machine", as claimed by its founder, Norbert Weiner in 1948. 

Cybernetics involves assessing how systems utilize and respond to feedback and information. It is a close sibling to Claude Shannon's information theory, and it's no coincidence that both were founded in the same year of 1948, a year when control theory, homeostasis, and other topics were gaining momentum.
