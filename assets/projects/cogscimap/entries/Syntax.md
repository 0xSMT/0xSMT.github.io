Syntax is a means of structuring language, both natural and artificial. 

In languages, certain rules are expected to be followed. These rules (while often flexible in natural language) is what grants language a sense of organization and predictability. By following the rules, patterns emerge in language. The patterns 

In programming languages, syntax describes the organization of the program. For the computer to read and execute the program, it needs to know the syntactic structure of the program's originating programming language. This is because the syntactic rules guides the semantic meaning of the program: tracing the syntactic parse of the program generates the semantic parse (the execution) of the program.

Syntax can also related to meaning in natural language -- ambiguous syntactic parses (such as the infamous "time flies like an arrow") can lead to varying semantic interpretations. Such ambiguity in syntax is unallowable in computer science, but readily permissible in natural communication. Pragmatically, the listener often knows what the speaker intends based on contextual clues. Compilers, and more generally computers, are clueless to this context.
