Communication is the general process by which cognitive agents and systems share information. Communication takes several forms, such as through language, nonverbal cues, electric signals, music -- anything that caries information, and anything can carry information. 

The interpretation of communication is process that involves heavy symbol interpretation, and from a semiotic perspective, information interpretation depends on the transmitter, the content itself, and the receiver. 

Claude Shannon formalized a mathematical model fo communication in his treatise on Information Theory in 1948. Similarly, this model relies on encoding (at the transmitting front), the message content, distortion through a medium, and a decoder on the receiving end. This model of communication is very similar to the semiotic model, except more towards digital communication and encoding schemes.

Communication often requires a common protocol, or standard of communication, such that both the receiver and transmitter can understand one another. This typically takes the form of language.

But consider a more abstract case, where the transmitter is providing information, but the interpretation of that signal is subjective to the listener, such as art. Art will be giving the same signal (sensory input) to everyone, bu the interpretation by each receiver is different. Each decoder for each individual is different, which is why a piece of art can be interpreted so differently by different people. Inferring a cognitive agent's language in this respect is an interesting task in cognitive science and computational semiotics.
