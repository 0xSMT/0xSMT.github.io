The brain is the physical implementation of the most sophisticated cognitive system to date: the human mind. Acting as the central subject of neuroscience (and psychology), along with the peripheral and supplementary components of the nervous system, the brain is important to understand and dissect. An adequate understanding of brain operation is instrumental in understanding the biological basis of complicated psychological phenomena. 

The brain in humans is the central location of all cognitive processing, and is responsible for tasks such as language, motor control, planning, reasoning, emotional processing, processing sensory input (sight, sound, taste) along with a motley of other tasks. TO this end, the brain is localized in areas of functioning, although these regions are often not as localized as past claims in neuroscience stipulate. 

Of particular interest to the cognitive effort are the cerebral cortex (largest site of neural integration, and associated with several psychological processes such as attention and planning), cerebellum and motor cortices (motor control), and the thalamus (as an information filter).
