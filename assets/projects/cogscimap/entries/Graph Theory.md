Graph theory is a branch of mathematics responsible for network graphs. 

Network graphs are a common model of displaying related information: concepts are circles (called nodes), and relationships are lines connecting them (called edges). The interface you're using right now is a network graph!

Graphs are a common model in cognitive science. Neural networks are graphs, Bayesian nets are graphs, Markov Decision Processes are graphs, flowcharts (a visual format of programs) are graphs. Graphs are an aesthetic and intuitive method fo grouping information and describing information flow, and information flow is a key component of cognition.
