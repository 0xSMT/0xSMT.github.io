Recursion is a useful, fundamental, and often confusing concept in computer science.

A recursive relationship is one where an object depends upon itself in some way. Typically this involves reducing itself in some way, such that the recursion does not continue infinitely -- a recursive algorithm must terminate, as termination is a criterion for an algorithm.

Recursion in computer science is when a function calls itself. 

Consider the Fibonacci sequence, defined as: `f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)`, where `f(0) = 1` and `f(1) = 1`.

Recursion occurs throughout cognitive science. Linguistic rules are often recursive (such as nested adjectives in syntax rules), and proof themselves employ recursive strategies. Metacognition, thinking about thinking, is a niche example of recursion within cognitive psychology.
