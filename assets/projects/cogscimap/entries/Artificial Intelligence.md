Artificial intelligence (often abbreviated AI) is the attempted duplication of cognitive processes in a computational environment. 

The topic of AI is one with shifting goalposts, and rather than a strict framework, is more of an arbitrary label for types of problems. If you think about any task a computer executes, the same task done by a human certainly requires intelligence on the human side. Virtually any action done by a human does is deemed to be a byproduct of "intelligent life." So why are some problems in computer science deemed worthy of the label "AI" and others not?

In this sense, artificial intelligence is a label for tasks done by computers that is believed to be reserved for humans, or outside of the realm of tasks typically associated with computers. Tasks considered *now* rudimentary for computers (such as solving parabolic trajectories) are not referred to as AI. Tasks for computers at the forefront of their computational potential (such as path planning, natural language processing, winning human games) are described as AI.
