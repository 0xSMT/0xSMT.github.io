The mind is the abstract entity that forms the topic of conversation in cognitive science. The mind is a label for the ensemble of processes that leads to the emergence of cogntion (for that entity).

A mind ia very nebulous idea. A program can be said to have a mind, but certain not in the same capacity that a person is sadi to have one. A dog also possesses a mind, as might a hive of bees, or a social network of people. What characteristics unify these variants?

A mind is a set of procedures that allows for making actions given a state, in the most general sense. It involves some degree (or perhaps entirely) amount of computation and reasoning to do so. A mind allows for adaptation, and can process information to use later (where information processing itself can be viewed as an action, and the arrival of message or information as a feature of a state).

A dead toad reacting to an electric pule is not said to have a mind -- this is a reflex, an electric circuit. A mind dismisses the behaviorist reductionism. This is not to say that a mind is not reducible. But a mind is not merely reflex -- it invovles some adaptation and computation beyond automatic response.
