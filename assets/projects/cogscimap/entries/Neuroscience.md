Neuroscience is concerned primarily with the problem of how cognition emerges in biological contexts. Nervous systems are incredibly complex biological systems that allow for powerful information processing and control systems. Teh sheer amount of cognitive complexity that can be achieved with an interconnected network of interacting elements is a feat of natural engineering.

Studying the biology of cognition is very informative towards understanding the role of cognition. Research in how brains work a the neural level has been insightful in other disciplines towards the cognitive project. Computer science's neural networks are based on work in neuroscience, and developments within neuroscience (on attention, information filtering, etc) have continued to provide computational insight. 

Psychological phenomena are useful only when corroborated with the underlying physical features that allow them to emerge. In many respects, psychology is the study of the emergent behavior that arises from neurological systems. Bridging the gap between these two perspectives is important -- it provides validity to psychological hypotheses, and guides the direction of neurological research. Some emergent phenomena are also not entirely reducible to the neurological -- the history of the neurological system (the history of a person) can influence the neurological development of the brain (such as memories), and this is is not complete (if at all) reducible to neural structure. Psychology can lend a hand in these cases.
