Evolution is the infamous a theory pioneered by biologist Charles Darwin. It describes a process by which generations of species change and adapt their genetic makeup to better perform in their niche. Some amount of randomness occurs, via mutations and breeding, but a general trend of species developing new morphologies to better perform in their environment is a common factor. 

With respect to cognitive science, cognition itself is an evolutionary riddle. The emergence of nervous systems at all is a biological puzzle, and the human brain all the more so.

But in a less-literal sense, evolution is a guided stochastic process, and these are seen throughout cognition.
