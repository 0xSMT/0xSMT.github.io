Computer science is the scientific study of computation, where computation is defined as an algorithmic process. In other words, computer science is the study of algorithms -- their design, their effects, their implementation, and their characteristics.

A computer is an entity which executes an algorithm. The theoretical model of a computer is the Turing Machine, but as with most theoretical models, it can only be approximated in reality. The approximation is a computer, the device you're using to read this information right now. Computer science is concerned with algorithms, in both the theoretical and physical realms.

The relation of computer science to cognition is straight-forward: computation is a subset (if not an equivalent set) to the capability of cognition. Algorithms are certainly cognitive processes: many of your day-to-day tasks and procedures are representable as algorithms! 

Furthermore, computation serves as a good model of cognition, outside of thinking organisms themselves. Using computers, many tasks (such as object recognition, ) have been modeled as algorithmic processes. Simulations are also useful, and the computer simulation of biological organisms is an active area of study. And in fact, the simulation of an organism is (in some ways) reducing that organism's cognition to computation. In many respects, the ultimate goal of computer science is reducing cognition to computation, or rather, proving that the set of cognitive processes is a subset to the set of computable ones.

While computer science clearly contributes to cognitive science, the opposite also applies: insights into cognition prove useful to those within computer science. The current fad of computer science, artificial neural networks (ANNs), are mathematical models of neurological phenomena. This type of algorithm has proven incredibly useful in machine learning. Insights across the cognitive sciences have been instrumental in the progress within computer science.
