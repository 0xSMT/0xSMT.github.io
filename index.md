# Welcome to my Website!

Welcome to my website! This will serve as a centralized repository of anything I create that's worth recording and saving. I will be publishing a variety of material on this website, in an effort to improve my own abilities as a scholar, to have a time-stamped record of my academic progress, and as a contained location to reference any content I produce. I also have some nostalgia for the internet of the early 2000s, before internet giants monopolized the web, so this website serves as my own attempt to recapture that spirit of small, independent voices.

## About Me

My name is Samuel Taylor. I am interested in cognition and computation, and what I presume to be the intimate link between the two. My background is in computer programming -- I have been programming for a long time in a variety of mediums (robotics, machine learning, web-development, etc). In my undergraduate education, thanks to the inspiring Honors Program (helmed by Dr. Denise Dutton) at The University of Tulsa (TU), I realized my passion for cognitive science. Since then, my focus and spirit has been invested in research and reading between the lines of natural and 'artificial' cognition. I am presently completing my undergraduate education at TU in majoring in both Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Psychology. I am a current research assistant in the Computational Neuroscience and Adaptive Systems (CNAS) laboratory at TU, under the leadership of Dr. Roger Mailler. It is thanks to the combined experiences in both the Honors Program and as a research assistant that I have discovered my passion for the cognitive sciences.
